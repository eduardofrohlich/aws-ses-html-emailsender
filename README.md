## About this Project
This project demonstrates the integration of Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) with Spring Boot for sending styled emails. It covers the use of Spring Boot 3.2.5 and Java 17, leveraging Thymeleaf for HTML template processing and AWS Java SDK for seamless AWS services integration. This project was inspired by a challenge for a position at Uber, as presented by Fernanda Kipper | Dev in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFgeO9M9lLw). 

Key technologies used:
- **Java 17**: Modern Java development.
- **Spring Boot 3.2.5**: Framework for building Java applications.
- **Postman**: For testing our API endpoints.
- **Thymeleaf**: Java template engine for processing HTML.
- **BEE Free**: Tool for designing responsive and appealing email layouts ([BEE Free](https://beefree.io)).
- **AWS Java SDK**: Integrate Java applications with Amazon Web Services, including SES.
